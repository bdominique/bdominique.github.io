    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a fourth year CSE PhD Candidate at Northeastern University 
      working with Dr. Jennifer Dy in the [Signal Processing, Imaging, Reasoning, and Learning](https://web.northeastern.edu/spiral/) group (SPIRAL). 
      Prior to NEU, I completed my B.S. 
      in Computer Engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). My primary research 
      interests are at the intersection of Fairness, Transparency and Human-Centered Design, with a 
      focus on Skin Cancer Detection. I examine how fair data practices and the creation of new fairness 
      metrics can impact skin cancer outcomes for everyday people.
